# Netflix_Python_Data_analysis
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing all TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset, collected from Flixable (a third-party Netflix search engine), provides insights into the type, distribution, and availability of Netflix content over the years.
